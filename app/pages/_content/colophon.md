Polychroma is built with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) — a
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework — and
[chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs/) by Gregor&nbsp;Aisch.

It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for most of the styling,
with a few tweaks and custom&nbsp;styles.

The text is set in [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/),
specifically the 400, 600, and 700&nbsp;weights.
