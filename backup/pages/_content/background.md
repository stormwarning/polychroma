The idea for Polychroma started after discovering Bugsnag’s
[chromatic-sass](https://blog.bugsnag.com/chromatic-sass/) 
project. I loved the idea of a more natural-looking gradient, 
but I wanted a way to visualise the results without needing to 
update my dev&nbsp;stack.

I looked into the library that powered it — the amazing 
[chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs/) — and after tumbling 
down a rabbit hole of colour science and data visualisation, 
ended up with this simple little tool. Use it to grab a quick 
CSS snippet, or plug the resulting colour values into Figma,
Sketch, or your image editor of choice to use in&nbsp;mockups.
