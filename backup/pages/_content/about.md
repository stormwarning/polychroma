When defining a standard two-colour gradient, browsers 
interpolate using `RGB`, which can go through kind of greyish 
colours. `Lab` interpolation produces better, more
even&nbsp;results. 

Other interpolation modes (`HSL` and `Lch` for now, working on
adding more) are included as options for experimentation â€” the
results can be&nbsp;overly-saturated.
